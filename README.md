# Gaia Ecology
Demo website to ptactice `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `Git`

## To-Do

- Create a single page website
- publish to git repo
- create a web map using [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) and [OS data hub](https://osdatahub.os.uk/)

## Purpose
To learn HMTL and CSS and javaScript
Created a dummy website for a fictious ecology company
 - used materializecss (icons, colors)

CSS
- ids 
- classes
- images and fonts and color gradients 
- media queries (responsive design - mobile/tablet)
- hover events (for buttons)
- nested elements (i.e all h tags inside a div (.class>h tag))
- how to recolor images using filter brightness and invert
- used flexbox for the first time 


used a front end frame work (materializecss) - was advised not to use bootstrap as many examples use JQuery. JQuery has fallen out of favour. Materializecss has examples with both JQuery and vanilla javaScript (mike pointed this one out as it was slightly less complicated than other options but also has less features)
- Downloaded instead of using a CDN (dont know what it stands for but is a link to a file on the internet)
  
learnt about rows and columns (responsive design)
how to use external fonts using links (googlefonts)
found stock images and used them for backgrounds, icons  and images

GIT
- learnt how to create a repo in GITHUB. 
- how to create a branch
- how to commit 
- how to push commits locally and to origin (i.e GITHUB)
- learnt how to make a pull request
